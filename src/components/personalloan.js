                  A personal loan is a loan for your personal use, be it your
                  child’s wedding, a dream vacation, or a shopping extravaganza.
                  A personal loan does not require any security or collateral
                  and can be availed without much fuss. Typically personal loans
                  range from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 30 Lacs with a tenure typically
                  ranging from one to five years. Getting a Personal loan is
                  quite stress free and there are typically a number of offers
                  in the market most of the time. Apart from the rate of
                  interest banks also charge some fees which are usually of two
                  types. Once when you are applying for the loan and once when
                  you are pre-closing the loan. The fees when charged at the
                  time of processing called as Processing Fees vary from 2-3% of
                  the loan amount. This could be reduced if you have the ability
                  to bargain. the second charge is the prepayment penalty paid
                  at the time of pre-closure. This too varies from 2 – 3 %.
                  Similar to processing charges, you can also try to get this
                  fees reduced.

                  Personal loans eligibility criteria can be fairly stringent,
                  considering banks need to mitigate their risk. Most people
                  with a regular source of income such as salaried individuals
                  or self-employed individuals can avail a personal loan. Banks
                  consider salaried individuals, self-employed professionals and
                  self-employed business people.
