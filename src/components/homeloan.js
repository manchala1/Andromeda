                  A Home Loan is a secured loan product where the lender
                  provides finances for the purchase or construction of a
                  residential/commercial property. One can also avail a housing
                  loan to buy a plot of land and construct on it. Home Loans are
                  also issued to extend/ repair/ renovate/ alter a new or
                  second-hand property. The Home Loan is taken by a borrower
                  against the property/security to be bought. This is done by
                  giving the banker a conditional ownership over the property
                  i.e. if the borrower fails to pay back the loan, the banker
                  can retrieve the lent money by selling the property.
                  <br />
                  Most lenders get the property valued independently and provide
                  loans based on their estimated value. It is important to
                  remember, however, that frequently their valuation is
                  significantly lower than the actual cost and hence the
                  requirement of the borrowers goes up. Home loans in Indian
                  Banks are provided up to maximum of 80% (90% for loan amount
                  below INR 20 lakhs) of the value of the house. Home loans are
                  repaid using Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs) spread over a
                  fixed tenure.

                  Home Loan eligibility depends upon various factors. A few of
                  them are listed here –
                  <label>
                    <b>Income – </b>Your income determines the amount of home
                    loan you are eligible for. Banks generally keep the EMI to
                    income ratio at 0.45 to 0.50.
                  </label>
                  <label>
                    <b>Tenure – </b>The longer tenure you opt for, the more is
                    your home loan eligibility and the lesser is your EMI
                  </label>
                  <label>
                    <b>Age – </b>Your age will determine your home loan tenure
                    and hence your eligibility.
                  </label>
                  <label>
                    <b>Interest Rate offered – </b>Banks offer Fixed and
                    Floating Rates of Interest. If your interest rates are on a
                    lower side, then the loan eligibility will be higher..
                  </label>
                  <label>
                    <b>CIBIL Score – </b>Your credit report tells the bank about
                    your repayment capacity and hence determines if you’re
                    eligible for a loan.

                    Fixed interest rate refers to repayment of home loans in
                    fixed equal installments over the entire period of the loan.
                    In this case, the interest rate doesn’t change with market
                    fluctuations.
                  </label>
                  <label>
                    During the early part of the tenure, the monthly payments
                    are used to service the interest and the principal is served
                    in the later parts of the tenure.Very few lenders in India
                    offer pure fixed rates where the rate of interest remains
                    constant over the entire tenure. Most lenders have a reset
                    clause of 3-5 years. If the borrower is certain that the
                    rate of interest is the lowest in the market, only then
                    should he opt for fixed rates of interest.
